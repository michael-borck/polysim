# PolySim

PolySim is a versatile simulation game built using the Flet framework, which allows you to write your application in Python and deploy it seamlessly across the web, Android, iOS, and desktop platforms. The simulator enable dynamic switching between game themes and mechanics via externally loaded JSON configuration files. The application is cross-platform and can run as a web app, desktop app, or on mobile devices.

## Features

- **Flet Framework Integration:** Build interactive UIs with Python for diverse platforms.
- **Modular Game Design:** Switch seamlessly between game themes like business management and space exploration.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Game settings and rules are loaded dynamically from JSON files.
- **Extensible and Scalable:** Designed to easily incorporate additional themes and game mechanics.
